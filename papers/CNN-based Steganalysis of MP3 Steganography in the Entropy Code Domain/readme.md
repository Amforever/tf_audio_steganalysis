## Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper presents an effective steganalytic scheme based on CNN for detecting MP3 steganography in the entropy code domain. These steganographic methods hide secret messages into the compressed audio stream through Huffman code substitution, which usually achieve high capacity, good security and low computational complexity. **First**, unlike most previous CNN based steganalytic methods, the quantified modified DCT (QMDCT) coefficients matrix is selected as the input data of the proposed network. **Second**, a high pass filter is used to extract the residual signal, and suppress the content itself, so that the network is more sensitive to the subtle alteration introduced by the data hiding methods. **Third**, the 1 x 1 convolutional kernel and the batch normalization layer are applied to decrease the danger of overfitting and accelerate the convergence of the back-propagation. **In addition**, the performance of the network is optimized via fine-tuning the architecture. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed CNN performs far better than the traditional handcrafted features. In particular, the network has a good performance for the detection of an **adaptive** MP3 steganography algorithm, equal length entropy codes substitution (**EECS**) algorithm which is hard to detect through conventional handcrafted features. The network can be applied to various bitrates and relative payloads seamlessly. **Last but not the least**, a sliding window method is proposed to steganalyze audios of arbitrary size.
